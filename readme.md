# DSonPSP
Based on `DSonPSP BETA 0.7` by [yoshihiropsp](https://sourceforge.net/u/yoshihiropsp/), [Original SVN source here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/donpsp/).

# Compatibibiliy 
Compatibility is pretty poor and the few games that work are very slow. You can find a small [compatibility list here](http://www.consolespot.net/forums/psp-homebrew/26594-dsonpsp-compatibility-list.html), but it is incomplete and not specific to my build of the emulator. Most games will give you a white screen.
